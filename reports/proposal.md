## Overview
This project focuses on creating a simple interactive game with C from scratch. The game will be similar to old Shoot'em up gerne games like the *Space Invaders(1978)* in sense graphics and style. Characters and enemies will be portrayed as simple symbol characters (such as @, *, $), and the game will run on either terminal window or an external window from the windows.h library. The main goal will be using the arrow keys to survive as long as possible from emerging enemies - the character that moves with the user input will shoot bullets automatically toward the enimies. When user picks up the power-up item, the number of bullets and speed of bullets will vary so that the player can survive longer. The MVP for this project will be able to get user input, be able to collide with an enemy (game over condition), be able to kill an enemy with the bullet. Stretch goal will be making the game more engaging by adding multiple enemies that have simple AI, adding power-up system, adding score system, and adding difficulties over time. We are confident that we will be able to finish the MVP, but hope we can finish all the stretch goals in time.

## Learning Goals
